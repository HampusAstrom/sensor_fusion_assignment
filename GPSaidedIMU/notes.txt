Large eastward error small altitude error, no north-south error.    

exp(t/14)-1

Error is very similar if latitude is set correctly in both gravity and error_growth
But Eastward error is a bit bigger in Stockholm wthile altitude error is a bit bigger in Lund
Final timestep measures:

    0.1614

S-L

    4.5972

If there is a missmatch, then of course the altitude will become wrong.
